It's me **Birat Gautam**, a.k.a `@ToniBirat7` in duality. <br>
⚽ Yes, **Toni** inspired by the calm, composed midfielder **Toni Kroos**. If code were football, I’d be playing deep building from the back, dictating the flow.

What am I doing?

- Pursuing Bsc (Hons) Computer Science with AI [@BirminghamCityUniversity](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/)
- Want to understand the working of a **computer from scratch** yes, I’m *literally* talking **flip-flops and transistors**
- Current Interest **AI**, **Fullstack Development** and **DSA**

> *"Fix each transistor to create a bit."*

Sounds insane, right? That’s the point. Sanity doesn’t innovate.

I'm not here just to use computers.
I want to **understand them**, **design them**, **breathe life into them bit by bit**.

---

You see code, it is not just logic; it's a unseen frequency that tunes into reality.  
Life? It’s not just about 0s and 1s, it’s about **balance**, **depth**, and **knowing your trueself**

---

I love exploring things from scratch because **starting from nothing is the closest you can get to creation**.
