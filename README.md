It's me **Birat Gautam**, a.k.a `@ToniBirat7` in duality. <br>
⚽ Yes, **Toni**—inspired by the calm, composed, and disciplined midfielder **Toni Kroos**. If code were football, I’d be playing deep building from the back, dictating the flow.

What am I doing?

- Want to build a **computer from scratch**—yes, I’m *literally* talking **flip-flops and transistors**.
- Currently learning **Backend Engineering**, **AI**, **Fullstack Development** and **Socket Programming**
- Passioante about **System Design**, **DSA**, and everything that makes machines “tick”.

---

> *"Fix each transistor to create a bit."*

Sounds insane, right? That’s the point. Sanity doesn’t innovate.

I'm not here just to use computers.
I want to **understand them**, **design them**, **breathe life into them**—**bit by bit**, in silence.

---

> *"Want to win fairly, with seriousness, with love, with smile, with the divinity within me."*

You see code, it is not just logic; it's a unseen frequency that tunes into reality.  
Life? It’s not just about 0s and 1s, it’s about **balance**, **depth**, and **knowing your trueself**

Sometimes, I pause while debugging… and ponder:  
**What is this function of life?**  
**Is recursion just karma?**

---

I love building from scratch because **starting from nothing is the closest you can get to creation**.  
Every bug I solve feels like **untangling cosmic chaos**.

## Are You Still Reading?

> Maybe you didn’t come here to learn about code.  
> Maybe you’re here for a reason beyond algorithms.  
> So… ask yourself:
>
> **What are you building?**  
> **Why are you building it?**  
> **What does your code say about you?**  
> **And when the terminal clears, what remains?**
